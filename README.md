This Repository contains my assignment for SPARTA 2023, which contains a simple website as a prerequisite to my assignment
This project is a simple website and is created using HTML. This website contains basic information on myself such as a short introduction, interests and talent, projects that I have worked on, and also my contacts

# How To Use Program
how to use this program, first of all, you need to download all the files in this repository, and after that, you can just use Google Chrome to see what the website looks like

# Additional Information
this program is created by M. Abizzar Gamadrian of Bandung Institute of Technology, this is the first time i have worked with html and css so there was a lot of things i had to learn, the difficulties i faced when making this program are how to put the image in the website and also the difficulties with learning a new language, for the bonuses that are related to this task i'm ashamed to say that i did not do any of them because frankly i don't know where to start because i don't have guidance in making this program and i don't have anymore time to learn to learn new things and for that i just want to say that i'm sorry for the underwhelming performance.
